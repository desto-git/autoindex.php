About
-----
Apache's mod_autoindex styling capabilities are heavily limited. This .php script tries to solve this.
You can see it in action [here](https://desto.hercules.uberspace.de/autoindex.php/).



Installation
------------
Throw the `.autoindex` folder, `.autoindex.php` and `.htaccess` into the root of your webserver and you should be good to go. If you already have a `.htaccess` file, add its content to your existing one.
