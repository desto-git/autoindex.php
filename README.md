About
-----
Apache's mod_autoindex styling capabilities are heavily limited. This .php script tries to solve this.
You can see it in action [here](https://desto.dev/autoindex.php/).



Installation
------------
Throw the `.autoindex` folder, `.autoindex.php` and `.htaccess` into the root of your webserver and you should be good to go. If you already have a `.htaccess` file, add its content to your existing one.



Customization
-------------
To change some default configurations and styles, use the `.autoindex.cfg` directory. It isn't available by default, so it won't be accidentally overwritten in case of an update. The `example` folder contains a sample config directory with further instructions.
