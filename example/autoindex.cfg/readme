to use custom settings, rename this dir to ".autoindex.cfg" (add a dot) and place it alongside the .autoindex.php file

default settings can be found in .autoconfig/config.{js,php}

file names are hardcoded, so they need be named as follows to be recognized:
- "config.js" for javascript settings
- "config.php" for php settings
- "style.css" for custom styles

favicon can be set via config.php, so no strict name there
though that's only because it can be a different file type from .png, like .ico
